# **CHATBOT_HTML_CSS_JS**
In this project, I set out to create a chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as taught by [CodingNepal on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv8FORu-ACA&list=PLpwngcHZlPadhRwryAXw3mJWX5KH3T5L3).

I couldn't utilize OpenAI API for responses and until I sort out my account billing issues this project will remain pending.

Checkpoints:
- [x] HTML & CSS Start
- [x] JavaScript Start
- [x] Adding User Message to the Chatbox
- [ ] Generating Response for User Messages
- [ ] Auto-Scrolling the Chatbox
- [ ] Toggling Chatbot Visibility with Button Click
